# odin-recipes
This project is the first project of The Odin Project. It has been created to showcase my understanding of the various HTML tags as well the CSS I have learnt during the course. I have created a home page that links to three different pages that holds the ingredients and steps for a recipe.


In this project I learned:
- How to link pages together and add images to my website.
- The differences between ul and ol.
- How headers and paragraphs display on the page.
