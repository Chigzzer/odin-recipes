# odin-recipes
This project is the first project of the Odin Project.
It will be to create a recipe website to utilise the HTML skills I have learnt.

In this project I learned:
- How to link pages together and add images to my website.
- The differences between ul and ol.
- How headers and paragraphs display on the page.
